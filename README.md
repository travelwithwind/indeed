# indeed

It's really 麻烦 to fill forms. So I build a chrome extension to do that. 



## fill form 

Click on a job you like and hit apply now. The extension will form out the form based on your personal data in data.json

keyboard shortcut: **shift+alt+E**



## shortcut to dislike a job

Press **d** while hovering over a job you do not like.
